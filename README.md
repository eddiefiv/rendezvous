# Rendezvous
Rendezvous is a mobile app for community natural disaster relief (note: due to time constraints, Rendezvous is focused on hurricanes for now).
## Pages and Features
### Main Page
Displays a feed of public posts from other users and officials. Official news would be pinned up top for emphasis, showing major weather updates and other related news. Users can post questions they may have, advice they want to offer, or other relevant conversations.
### Giving
Allows users to host donation drives and fundraisers directly in the app. Donation drives would include drop-off addresses, that when pressed will direct the user to a separate maps app. It would also show a countdown of how many days the user has left to drop off items before they are collected. Users are also able to host fundraisers in the app that will allow other users to donate in the app instead of going to a third-party application.
### Offer
Another forum page specifically for users to post requests for supplies that they need or supplies they have to give away. All exchanges will be for free.
### Notifications
Displays user's notifications including any messages for offers, updates from fundraisers or donations that they supported, important weather updates, or updates from any posts that they watched.
### Other
User profile page, settings
## Background
After the recent tragedies from Hurricane Helene in Western NC, affecting people we know personally, we were motivated to make this app to provide direct access to help. The app is for everyone, but two main user groups were in mind: people who need help and people who can help.
